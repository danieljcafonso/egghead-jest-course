1. You can create a test by using the pattern <nameOfTheFileYouWantToText>.test.js
2. On that file now you can create a `describe` block. This block will be used to group several related tests.
3. Inside your describe block you can use `it` or `test` to create a method to run your tests.
4. Run `yarn test` on the console to see your test run
